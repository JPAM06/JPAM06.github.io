  abstract = {Staff assessed the net benefits of investing in resilient infrastructure through a highly stylized Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model. The model was developed to quantify the return of investment in infrastructure resilient to natural disasters—such as cyclones, tornadoes, and floods that destroy a share of public and private capital and temporary reduce productivity—as well as the macroeconomic impact of climate change based on an explicit parametrization of frequency and intensity of natural disasters, which affect not only the near-term dynamic responses of the economy after each natural disaster but also the long run equilibrium.},
