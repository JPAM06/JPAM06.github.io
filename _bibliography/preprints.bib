abstract = {The article contributes to the study of the current state and the economic outlook of the pension system in Colombia by means of three types of analysis: (i) the description of the system based on statistics about coverage, fidelity rates, transfers between regimes and impact on public finances, among others, (ii) estimations and long-run projections of demographic trends in Colombia and (iii) the analysis of the evolution and the effect of the two main regimes (the pay-as-you-go scheme and the private-savings one) on macroeconomic variables such as savings, interest rates, wages, taxes and social welfare.},

  abstract = {This technical note and manual (TNM) addresses the following issues: • Evaluating the full implications from the policies adopted to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy requires a well-developed macroeconomic framework. This note illustrates how such frameworks were used to analyze Colombia and Cambodia's shock impact at the beginning of the pandemic. • The use of macroeconomic frameworks is not to infer general policy conclusions from abstract models or empirical analysis but to help policymakers think through and articulate coherent forecasts, scenarios, and policy responses. • The two country cases illustrate how to construct a baseline scenario consistent with a COVID-19 shock within structural macroeconomic models. The scenario is built gradually to incorporate the available information, the pandemic's full effects, and the policy responses. • The results demonstrate the value of combining close attention to the data, near-term forecasting, and model-based analyses to support coherent policies.},
