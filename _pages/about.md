I am an economist working as research analyst at the IMF. My reseach interest focuses on dynamic macroeconomics 

Before the IMF I worked as economist at the central bank of Colombia where I contributed in developing bank's DSGE models, especially focused on monetary and fiscal policy and other quantitative models for measuring the impact of fiscal policy in the economy.
